# Hebrew Transliteration
 A program to transliterate Hebrew text into readable English transliteration, according to my somewhat arbitrary standards, which are, however, quite similar to those standards employed in most transliterated Hebrew publications.

 Originally created to ease my publication projects for the Slifka center--namely, a transliterated Hebrew prayer book and two Shabbat song books. It can nevertheless be applied to any Hebrew text.

 The program isn't perfect and definitely requires human intervention to create a finalized, readable version of the text. But it does >80% of the work.

Further work will use actual Hebrew grammatical rules to determine when to use shva na/shva nach, and determine when to use "e"s instead of "'"s to represent them. Will also increase efficiency of the programming by switching to working on one word at a time, rather than constantly recovering the current word.
